# ShopStore — Grocery eCommerce Landing Page

ShopStore is a modern, high-converting **grocery eCommerce landing page** built for showcasing products, promotions, and store features with a clean UI and smooth user experience. It’s designed as a **front-end UI template** that can be used for real online grocery shops, product catalogs, or eCommerce theme demos — and can be integrated later with any backend (WooCommerce, Shopify headless, custom APIs, Firebase, etc.).

This project focuses on **pixel-clean layout**, reusable UI sections, and responsive behavior across all devices, while keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to maintain.
